## DESCRIPTION

Jot Notes is a full stack web application that utilizes a front end with Vue.js and Javascript and a backend written in Express/Node.js and MongoDB for the database. It also uses Auth0 for authorization, allowing users to create accounts and add content. The application is designed to allow users to create Jots, or notes, and sort them into Notebooks (even multiple notebooks per jot!). Users can edit their Jots, Notebooks, and read the public Jots and Notebooks of others. They can choose whether or not their own content is public or private.
