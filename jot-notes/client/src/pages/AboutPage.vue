      <h1>What Jot Does</h1>
      <p>Jot is a note taking platform that allows you to access your notes from any browser. You can share your Jots as public or keep them private, edit them, and keep them in notebooks. Jot is free for all users and offers a efficient and effective interface for creating, editing, and accessing your notes.</p>
      <h2>How to get started?</h2>
      <p>Sign up for a free account above. Then simply create your first jot and remember your login information to access it later.</p>
      <h2>Who can see my stuff?</h2>
      <p>Either everyone or just you - it's up to you! We don't share information and we don't care if you want private or public jots - that's all up to you!</p>
